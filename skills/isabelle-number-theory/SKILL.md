# Isabelle Number Theory

## Overview

This skill covers computational number theory in Isabelle/HOL, focusing on concepts essential for cryptography: modular arithmetic, primality, greatest common divisors, extended Euclidean algorithm, and the Chinese remainder theorem. These form the foundation for both classical RSA-style cryptography and modern lattice-based schemes.

## Quick Use

- Read `references/number-theory.md` before answering number theory questions
- Use HOL-Number_Theory for advanced results
- Leverage Code_Target_Numeral for efficient computation

## Response Checklist

- Modular operations use correct syntax (mod, div)
- GCD and extended GCD computed correctly
- Primality testing approaches are appropriate
- CRT application conditions verified (coprimality)
- Euler's theorem and Fermat's little theorem applied correctly
- Modular inverses exist only for coprime elements
