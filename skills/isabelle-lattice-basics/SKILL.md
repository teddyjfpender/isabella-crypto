# Isabelle Lattice Basics

## Overview

This skill covers mathematical lattice theory in Isabelle/HOL. Lattices are algebraic structures with meet (greatest lower bound) and join (least upper bound) operations. Understanding lattices is foundational for lattice-based cryptography, order theory, and abstract interpretation.

## Quick Use

- Read `references/lattice.md` before answering questions about lattice structures
- Use HOL-Algebra for abstract lattice theory
- Distinguish between order-theoretic and algebraic definitions

## Response Checklist

- Correct lattice axioms stated (associativity, commutativity, absorption, idempotence)
- Partial order derived correctly from lattice operations
- Complete vs bounded vs distributive lattices distinguished
- Lattice homomorphisms preserve meet and join
- Examples provided from common lattice instances (powerset, divisibility, etc.)

## Example Requests

- "How do I define a lattice in Isabelle?"
- "What's the relationship between partial orders and lattices?"
- "How do I prove something is a complete lattice?"
- "How do I define lattice homomorphisms?"
- "What lattice structures are in the Isabelle library?"
