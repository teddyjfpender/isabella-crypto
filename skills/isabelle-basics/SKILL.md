# Isabelle Basics

## Overview

This skill covers the fundamentals of writing Isabelle/HOL theories. Isabelle/HOL is an interactive theorem prover based on Higher-Order Logic, widely used for formal verification of mathematical proofs and software systems. Understanding the basics of theory files, imports, definitions, and lemmas is essential for any Isabelle development.

## Quick Use

- Read `references/basics.md` before answering questions about Isabelle theory structure
- Focus on correct syntax for theory headers, imports, and basic constructs
- Ensure proper indentation and formatting conventions

## Response Checklist

- Theory file structure is correct (header, imports, body, end)
- Import statements include all necessary theories
- Definitions use proper `definition` or `abbreviation` syntax
- Lemmas have clear names and explicit types where needed
- Basic proofs use appropriate methods (auto, simp, etc.)
- Code follows Isabelle naming conventions (snake_case for values, CamelCase for types)

## Example Requests

- "How do I create a new Isabelle theory file?"
- "What's the syntax for importing other theories?"
- "How do I define a simple function in Isabelle?"
- "What's the difference between definition and abbreviation?"
- "How do I write a basic lemma with proof?"
