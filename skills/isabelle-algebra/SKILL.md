# Isabelle Algebra

## Overview

This skill covers abstract algebra in Isabelle/HOL, focusing on algebraic structures essential for cryptography: groups, rings, fields, polynomial rings, and quotient constructions. These structures underpin both classical and lattice-based cryptography.

## Quick Use

- Read `references/algebra.md` before answering algebraic structure questions
- Use HOL-Algebra for abstract structures with carriers
- Use type classes for concrete instantiations

## Response Checklist

- Correct algebraic axioms (associativity, identity, inverses)
- Distinguish between HOL-Algebra locales and type classes
- Ring homomorphisms preserve addition and multiplication
- Ideal and quotient ring constructions are correct
- Polynomial ring operations defined properly
- Field extensions and algebraic closures handled carefully

- "How do I construct a quotient ring Z[X]/(f(X))?"
- "How do I prove something is a ring homomorphism?"
